## Hello World, I'm Jubaer 👋

I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at **Daffodil International University** who is passionate about learning programming and building practical projects. I enjoy working on both academic and personal projects, and I like to understand how real systems work in areas such as networking, databases, and software development. I have a growing interest in artificial intelligence and deep learning, and I enjoy learning step by step, improving my problem-solving skills, and writing clean and well-structured code. I use GitHub to share my learning journey, track my progress, and continuously improve my coding and system design skills through real projects.

- 🎓 CSE undergraduate  
- 🌱 Currently focusing on Python and system-oriented project development  
- 📚 Preparing for my final year project (thesis)
